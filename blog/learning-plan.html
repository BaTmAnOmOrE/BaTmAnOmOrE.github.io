      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <p>What is your long term goal or career pathway? </p>
      <br>
      <p class="red-text">To get a job in the IT industry</p>
      <br>
<p>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> I would say my greatest strengths are as a problem solver and communication skills. My weaknesses would be getting anxious 
  when I can't solve something</p>
  <br>
<p>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">I would like to build on my confidence</p>
<br>
<p>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p>
<p>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">Be respective,Honest and hardworking with your cohort members and facilitators.Take all feedback good or bad and improve on it</p>
<p>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p>
<p class="red-text"> Take a 10 minute break and come back to it </p>
<p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> First google search the answer, if you can't find the answer ask your cohort and If they don't answer back, ask a facilitator</p>
<br>
<p>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> I expect the facilitators to help for guidance if you're on the right track with your work and assitance if you're stuck on code. </p>
<br>
<p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should arrange them together so that you feel they are clearly communicated.
<br>
<p class="red-text"> I work part-time on weekends and some public holidays </p>
