      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
      <p>What is your long term goal or career pathway? </p>
      <br>
      <p class="red-text">To get a job in the IT industry</p>
      <br>
<p>A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> I would say my greatest strengths are as a problem solver and communication skills. My weaknesses would be getting anxious 
  when I can't solve something</p>
  <br>
<p>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">I would like to build on my confidence</p>
<br>
<p>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</p>
<p>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">Be respective,Honest and hardworking with your cohort members and facilitators.Take all feedback good or bad and improve on it</p>
<p>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</p>
<p class="red-text"> Take a 10 minute break and come back to it </p>
<p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> First google search the answer, if you can't find the answer ask your cohort and If they don't answer back, ask a facilitator</p>
<br>
<p>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> I expect the facilitators to help for guidance if you're on the right track with your work and assitance if you're stuck on code. </p>
<br>
<p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should arrange them together so that you feel they are clearly communicated.
<br>
<p class="red-text"> I work part-time on weekends and some public holidays </p>

<h1>Part 2 Post Foundation Learning Plan</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> To get a job in the IT industry but have a passion of building video games</p>
<p>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">Any skills learnt is always a benefit and I'm hoping the next job I apply for will help me utilise this skills and build on what I have.</p>
<br>
<p> do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">I belive bootcamp will give me an almost realistic feeling of working in a web development company 
  as we will be working within a team</p>
<br>
<p>What are you hoping to use the skills you gain during this course for? What impact would you like to make once you leave Dev Academy? Do you have a destination in mind?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">Like everyone here at DevAcademy, we are all here to use the skills we have learned to land a job in the IT industry. 
  I hope to have made friends who I will be in touch with post bootcamp.</p>
<p>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
<br>
<p class="red-text">My biggest strengths that I learned during the 5 sprint challenges is motivation. 
  Having a "Never say die" attitude will allow me to work through a difficult challenge without having negative thoughts. 
  My only limitation would be trying to make time for myself.
<br>
<p>Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2. Has your idea of these changed throughout Foundations? 
  Have you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> Since writing the learning plan in sprint 2, I am now much more confident/motivated and thinking out of the box</p>
<p>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
<br>
<p class="red-text">A new working environment for pair coding with different cohort members would definitely be no brainer. 
  Not saying this would happen but having a teammate who does not add any input to the challenge can be taxing on the rest of the team.</p>
  <br>
<p>While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp, this is not what we 
  would like you to consider in this plan. Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the material, 
  working in groups, speaking in front of the group, keeping focused for nine weeks, etc.</p>
<br>
<p>non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
<br>
<p class="red-text">I would love to see my decision and pair problem solving skills develop.</p>
<br>
<p>At Dev Academy, we have a significant focus on human skills and improving yourself.
   Based on your strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would like to work on?</p>
<br>
For example, this could be communication, teamwork within groups, 
pairing with others, giving and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, 
or improving your self-awareness and reflective skills.</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">Building on my self-felection and developing leadership skills would be my main focus</p>
<br>
<p> What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">Like in foundations, I'm hoping for the Bootcamp Team to be available if you're really stuck on something 
  or if you need guidance on part of the project</p>
<br>
<p>What does support look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the Bootcamp team's expectations, 
  but it is helpful to voice these expectations.</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">I tend to use Google alot for anything I'm stuck on. If I can't find out the answer ask your cohort members. 
  If you dont get any replies in 5-10 minutes contact the Bootcamp Team for help</p>
<br>
<p>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> To gain experience working with a team in a different work enviroment and to learn new material</p>
<br>
<p>Based on your knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely way?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">The efficient way of seeking help is knowing what to ask and what you are stuck on.
Also having a code example where you are stuck</p>
<br>
<p>Write down a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively 
and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">creating a To Do List and writing each task/Subtask that needs to be completed within a timeframe
  allocating a task fairly to all memebers of the project and respect yourself and your project members, facilitators 
  as they may have other commitments outside of studies.
