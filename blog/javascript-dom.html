  <h1>The relationships of Javascript , HTML and CSS</h1>

<p>Think of a building 
The HTML would be a structure of the building
CSS would be the design for the interior and exterior of the building
JavaScript would be functions of the building </p>
<br>
<br>

<p>The above comes hand in hand without the html there will be no building, without the CSS
there will be no styling on the building interior/exterior. 
Without the JavaScript the building will not have any use 
</p>
<br>
<p>Form Controls are like ordering your coffee in the morning
You open the website, you select your desired coffee and amount and pay for it
</p>
<br>
<p>Flow is like signing in to a website and you enter your email incorrectly
i.e fake123gmail.com its going to say invalid entry because 
1) they are looking for an '@'
2) they are also looking for a password entry and correct credentials
</p>
<br>
<p>A Loop is like unlocking your phone
If you unlock your phone password incorrectly its 
going to let you know that it has been entered incorrectly and to enter the right password
If you enter it incorrectly again its going to tell you you have x amount of times to enter the password correctly
If you exeed that amount of times it will remain locked and will tell you that you have to wait 3 minutes to try again
</p>

<h1>Diffences bwtween Arays and objects</h1>
<br>
<p>Arrays is a variable that can be ammended to store a list of values
Each item is accessed by the items index
Thin of a grocery list and which item you'll be getting first at 
the supermarket and once you get it you cross it off the list </p>
<br>
<p>Objects on the otherhand is a variable that can also be a ammended and stores a collection of values
Just think of A cup, it has a colour,design, size and material</p>
<br>
<p>Functions are on of the main building blocks  in JS.
It is used for calculating values or pewrforming a task. It always takes a input and output. 
To use a function you must first define it in which in the same scope to call the function.</p>
<br>
<p> for example</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">
function square(number)
<br> 
{
<br>  
  return number * number;
  <br>
}
</p>
<br>
<p>The above function takes a parameter 'number'
and returns the number parameter muliplied by itself
