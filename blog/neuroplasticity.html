    <h1> Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

    <p> The study of Neuroplasticity is repeating the same task over and over 
    again for a period of time until you master it.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Take for example a Bus Driver; The bus driver takes the same route daily and has mastered it 
    and does not have to keep thinking where he/she is going or where the next bus stop is </p>
    <br>
  <p> Neuroplasticity is helpful to me with studies because I'm learning new things all the time. saying that, I 
    will still need to keep going over the material until it sticks </p>
    <br>
    <p>Playing video games, learning a new language, learning an instrument are just some of the ways 
    that you can ways to increase your neuroplasticity</p>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rewiring-your-brain"> An article from Heathline explains neuroplasticity well.</a> 

<br>
<br> 
<p>A growth mindset means that you thrive on challenge, and you say no to failure. You're always developing your abilities and talents.</p>
<br>
<p>Think of a Taxi Driver unlike the Bus Driver he has to keep thinking as he/she will need to pick up passengers from an undisclosed area
 to drop them of them at their desired destination in the shortest distance and time possible.  </p>
<p>People with a growth mindset believe that intelligence and creativity, as well as things like relationships, can be developed with practice and patience. 
They are less likely to be discouraged by failure because they take past obstacles as learning opportunities. 
This allows them to feel happy and comfortable.</p>
<br> In the past  I had a fixed mindset having alot of negative thoughts that affected my mindset mentally and physically. 
After learning about growth Mindset it had put me back in the drivers seat; Where I need to be and help me to be more focused and motivated
 in my work and in my studies.
 <br>
 <p>Having a growth Mindset allows mw to self motivated and pesevere in my studies. 
   It also allows me to build relations with my cohort and facilitators.</p>

<p>Lastly, I want to touch on how growth Mindset shaped my learning plan and strategies.
It made me more confident;Both at work and Studies. It allowed me to be more self-motivated and hungry for challenges.
It has also taught me the most important thing failing is not the end of the world because you are a work in progress; Not yet!</p>
