    <h1> Problem Solving</h1>
    <h3>  A time when I was blocked on a simple problem.</h3>

    <p>A video game that I was playing had froze on me  however the ingame music was playing 
    so I was under the impression that my controller battery had just died on me. 
    I took a usb and plugged the controller directly to the console but there was no input happening.
    so again I assumed that it was a bad USB cable. 
    So I frantically looked for another cable and it did the same thing.
    I was about to purchase another USB cable online but I remembered that I had a wired controller lying around somewhere. 
    I used the wired controller and still had no input. 
    That's when it struck me to try the only thing that I did not try; Restarting the game console.
    To my surprise everything had worked it was just that the game had froze </p>
  <br>
<h3> A time when I elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
<p>A new starter at work had received a call in regards to a breakdown and the 
  said person was so nervous and was frantically trying to look for her notes. 
  I looked over my shoulder and saw that she was falling apart on the call so I shared a document 
  to her about the steps involved in any breakdown situation via email as I was also on a call at that moment. 
  That way she could read through the document whilst talking to her customer. </p>

  <p class =red-text>Pseudocode</p>
  <br>
  <p>Pseudocode is method which is use to write a series of steps of what is 
    to happen in each line of code in plain text. 
    It is a very helful tool that I use alot as it allows me to plan ahead and 
    make any adjustments before commiting to writing the code.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Below is a example of what Pseudocode looks like:</p>

  <p class="red-text">Trying something</p>
  <br>
  <p>You should always make a first attempt before seeking help.
    This is just to allow you to get a better undertanding of what the issue is,
    so that when you are asking for help you know that you are asking the right questions.
    I myself tend to do this alot to get and understanding and the logic behind the question at hand.
  </p>
  <p class="red-text">Rubber ducky method</p>
  <br>
  <p>In web programming the rubber ducky method is in regards to debugging lines of code.
  The practice of rubber ducking comes from a story in the book "The Pragmatic Programmer" 
  by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. 
  Ps you don't need a physical rubber ducky and can't say for certain 
  that I have used this method nor have played with a rubber ducky</p>
  <br>
  <p class ="red-text">Reading error messages</p>
  <br>
  reading error messages is a very useful tool to identify where you have stuffed up.
  This has helped me to identify fixes for things outside of studies 
  ie upgrading the software for your graphics card 
  and then it spits out an error that your current graphics card does not support the upgrade.
  The type of error code that appears sometimes as a text or sometimes in the form of a code or both.

  <p class = "red-text">Console.logging</p>
  <br>
  <p>Like the rubber ducky method console logging is another way to debug code.
  I don't use console logging alot as I use Pseudocode over it. 
  It might be a preferance thing.
   Using console.log() helps you to understand what your code is doing by displaying a message containing
   descriptive text that tells you what is happening.</p>

  <p class ="red-text">Googling</p>
  <p>using google should be your go to as its the biggest search engine and has all the answers; 
    you just need to know what to search. 
    I tend to use google alot just because when you have forgotten a git command you can quickly get the answers in few seconds.</p>
    <br>
  <p class="red-text">Asking your peers for help</p>
  <br>
  <p>Before asking your peers for help firstly ensure they are working on a similar material that you are working on.
  ie asking help for help for a challenge that's 3 weeks ahead and your peers are all in the first week challenge; You won't get any answers
  but your peers will feel discouraged and demotivated that you're moving ahead so quickly. 
  Also when asking a question,ensure  That you have done your research meaning 
  that you have attempted the question before asking for assistance so that your peers can help 
  and provide some useful insights.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p class="red-text">Asking coaches for help</p>
  <p>Just like asking your peers for help you would need to do your due diligence 
    meaning doing your own research and trial and 
    error testing and have discussed the said issue with your peers before requesting assistance from your coaches</p>
  <br>
  <p class="red-text">Improving your process with reflection</p>
  <p>
    To improve your reflection process there are many ways to improve it but these are the main ones:</p>
    <br>
    <p>Read -Do research on topics you are learning about or want to learn about and develop and keep practicing.</p>
     <p> Ask - Talk and have discussions with your peers about the way they do things and the reason why.</p>
     <p>Watch - observe what is going around you, outside studies and during studies.</p>
     <p> Feel - observe your emotions, what prompts them, and how you deal with</p>
  </p>
