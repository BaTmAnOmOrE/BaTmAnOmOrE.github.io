    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
    <p>1) Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
      <br>
      Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, 
      the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
      <br>
      Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
      <p class="red-text"> I had to make an etical decision at work recently.
      <br>
      A customer had called up and had complained that the trailer that she hired was not on site.
      <br>
      Our procedure is finding a similar sized trailer for her nearby and to relocate them to the said site.
      Unfortunately, this was not the case, as there were no trailers nearby but there was one available in the next township which was further away from 
      where she initially hired the tailer. 
      <br>
      After hearing the customers story, I felt compassinate because all she wanted was to spend time with her elderly parents and to give them some new funiture.
      <br>
      I offered the customer an extra day on her hire to allow her extra time to spend some time with her parents. 
       (Keep in mind we are only allowed to offer  up to 6 hours of extra time)
      <br> When my manager was back in the office, I told her what I had done to keep her in the loop but my manager was not impressed with my decision.
      </p>

        2) Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
        <br>
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</p>
        <br>
        <p class="red-text" > My greatest strengths would be being a Team Player, Being Punctual and having a positive and proactive attitude to learning 
          and applying my current knowlege for effective results.
        My weaknesses would be being meticulous in my work which can sometimes can be time consuming and may hinder other components of my learning and carreer development.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="red-text"> Being Punctual allows me to ensure that I have completed all the tasks within the given timeframe.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. </p>
        <p class="red-text"> When I was back at university, we were given a team assessment but some team members were not pulling their weight but still want to get credit
          for the assessment. This had caused some setbacks for the rest of the team, myself included.   </p>
          <br>
        <p>Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</p>
        <p class="red-text"> The remaing team members and I had to put in extra hours and to work twice as hard to achieve that Gold for the whole team.
          What I would do diffently is a appointing a team leader to ensure everyone in the team is doing their part and helping out.</p>
