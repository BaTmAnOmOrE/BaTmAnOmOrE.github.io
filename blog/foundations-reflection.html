      <h1>Foundations Reflections</h1>
<p> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">First thing that I have learned about myself would be that I'm self-motivated, 
  secondly,I learn material if I code it myself(i.e watch and code sessions,Udacity, etc). 
  lastly I have been able to work alongsides time constraints/timeframes.</p>
<br>
<p></p>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">This would be knowing my own emotinal trigger and also showing compassion/empathy for cohort members </p>
<br>
<p></p>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">That I had completed all my sprint challeges during the alloted timeframe</p>
<br>
<p></p>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">The most difficult aspects was the sprint 3 challenge as it was a big step up from the previous sprint challenges</p>
<br>
<p></p>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text"> I would say it is to prepare us for the real world once we finish bootcamp and go on to work in an IT industry</p>
<br>
<p>>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">I would not say it is a waste of time because any knowlede or new material you have learnt is always useful 
  so that you could bring this to a new job or to teach someone</p>
  <br>
<p>Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</p>
<br>
<p class="red-text">I would say yes and nobecause it would be a good idea to practice programming. 
  But on the other hand if we do not have any material to practice, then what are we acually practicing. </p>
